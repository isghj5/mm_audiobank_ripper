# mm_audiobank_ripper
Rips binary audiobank instrument sets from decompressed Majora Mask USA z64 roms

To extract a Majora mask instrument set from a decompressed USA MM Rom, either type in a console/terminal:
 python mm_audiobank_ripper.py YOURROMHERE.z64
or in windows, click and drag your rom file onto DropYourRomHere.bat

A new folder with all the individual banks should be created with the banks and their meta data.

Known bug: if you try to drag a rom from a different folder too distant from the ripper it will sometimes give error, move the rom to the folder first and try again.
